  <p> To many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, mole is staple in Mexican cooking that evokes memories of families working together in the kitchen to create the labor-intensive dish. On Memorial Day Weekend, residents of Chicago’s Pilsen brought mole out of the kitchen and into the streets for the largest ever Mole de Mayo festival in the city.</p>

<p>Made in many Mexican households, mole is a sauce usually made of various chili peppers, nuts, chocolate, and other spices and seasonings. While modern mole comes in a variety of flavors and ingredients, the classic version is typically red or brown and served over meat dishes or enchiladas.
   

 <p> 
   The 2016 Mole de Mayo festival celebrating the culture’s beloved sauce anticipated an estimated 50,000 attendees over its three days, the largest crowd the festival has seen.
  Despite the shrinking Mexican population--the Hispanic population was at 28,835 in 2013, a 26 percent drop since 2000--this increase in attendance at the seventh annual celebration showcases mole’s special ability to connect people, pulling not only the Mexican family together, but a city. </p>
   <p>“Mole is a very important staple to the Mexican community,” said Alejandra Garcia, an event coordinator from Eighteenth Street Development Corporation, the company who hosted the event. “Given that our event is pretty diverse, it is definitely sharing Mexican culture with any demographic out there.”</p>

<p>Approximately 50,000 people from the local and surrounding areas crowded two and a half blocks of 18th Street to enjoy the three-day long festivities that included live music, entertainers, traditional Mexican wrestling, various artisans and merchants and the tasty mole sauces prepared by dozens of local restaurants.The company aims to provide the Pilsen business community with resources and tools necessary to grow, said Garcia.</p>

  <p>Like in previous years, the festival’s main centerpiece was a mole cook-off that pitted various restaurants from the surrounding areas against each other to win two awards, the Mole de Mayo's Best Mole Award and the People's Choice Award. This year, La Esperanza took home the title of "Best Mole" while La Catrina Café placed first for "People's Choice." Owner of La Catrina Café, Salvador Corona, 43, made his mole stand out by making his mole spicier.</p>

<p>"It's just a different recipe and approach," said Corona. "And then we serve it on bread, and the taste changes totally."</p>
 <p>Despite the competition, however, most vendors agreed that when it comes to mole, what matters most is sharing the dish with family and friends.

  <p> Although guided by tradition, the festival left room for more unique approaches to mole. Xiomara Casas, 18, worked at Nueva Leon Panadería's stand at the festival. Growing up, Casas would go to her grandmother's house to eat her homemade green mole, but at the festival she helped create a new twist on the dish: savory mole on the Mexican sweet bread, la concha.</p>

<p>"We thought it would be a different way to attract customers," said Casas. "You get a little bit of the sweet and the savory."

The different styles of mole is what gets some people, like 51-year-old Silvia Saucedo, coming back year after year. The Southwest Side of Chicago native comes with her friends and family each year to sample the festival’s offerings.
  <p>“The restaurant [La Bomb] has a Puerto Rican basis, but they’re able to do their own spin on the Mexican dish,” Saucedo said. “It’s like a more modern fusion now, so I love that people are getting creative with it, and more people keep coming.”</p>

<p>Despite the leeway given with the mole, the festival still holds on tight to the Mexican tradition of family. Saucedo values the family-oriented nature of the event, as the festival’s environment appeals to both younger and older generations.</p>
     <p“There’s lots of families that come to this event because it reflects the culture of the community well,” Saucedo said. “Unlike some of the other events around here, it’s more family-fun and everyone is included.”</p>

<p>Besides mole, the festival captured the the spirit of the community by including other foods, music and activities associated with the Mexican culture. One highlight included a bull riding simulator that drew curious attendees of all ages interested in riding the bull--if only for several seconds.</p>

     <p> Though the event has expanded to different vendors and entertainment, for couple Jose Huerta, 25, and his girlfriend, Marya Plascencia, 24, the main draw was the familiarity of mole.  After seeing the event on Facebook, they thought it would be a perfect date night.</p>

<p>“We come to the area a lot and we knew mole is good, so we thought ‘Why not?’ There’s a first time for everything,” Huerta said. “The food has been great, and it’s been really awesome to see the energy of the culture.”</p>
